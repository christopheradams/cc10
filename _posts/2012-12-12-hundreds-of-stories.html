	<p class="lead">In Poland and South Africa students may download textbooks (that include videos and presentations) for free.  In <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/2012/04/digital-school-program-with-open-textbooks-approved-by-polish-government/">Poland</a> free digital textbooks will be provided to primary schools as part of a 'Digital Schools' program.  The program also aims to create a national repository of training materials.  The South African government has printed and distributed more than 2.4 million physical copies of <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2012/03/18/free-textbooks-project-helps-sa">Siyavula</a> textbooks at nominal cost. Each item costs roughly 40 rand, or 26 percent the cost of a traditional textbook.  Both projects use CC licenses. Similar initiatives are underway in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566">British Columbia</a> (Canada) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288">California</a> (USA).</p>

Anyone, anywhere can reuse them at zero cost.</p>

<p class="lead">The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGsJ0Clx08Q&feature=youtu.be">Libre Bus</a> is a project inspired by Free Culture principles. In 2012, 51 passengers rode the bus 8000 kilometres through Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, stopping to share open knowledge and practices via content production, talks, workshops and press promotion. More than 1,000 people were able to experience Librebus during the 35 days of travel to nearly 25 cities and in more than 40 events.</p>
