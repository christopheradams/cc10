<h1>Measuring the Commons: <span class="muted">CC at 10 Years.</span></h1>
		  
<p class="lead">Creative Commons’ vision is nothing less than realizing the full potential of the Internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity. Achieving that vision requires an understanding of the impact of CC tools and activities.</p>

<p class="lead">How many CC licensed items exist? When you use a Creative Commons license, how does your work contribute to global innovation? We’ve explored these questions and think you’ll be astonished at what we’ve found.</p>

<p class="lead">As the pool of CC-licensed content grows and diversifies, it becomes critical to study its reach and influence. Understanding how CC contributes to the global ecosystem will guide future initiatives and investment. This metrics report is a first step towards quantifying the impact of Creative Commons.</p>
